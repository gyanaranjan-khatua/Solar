    id: 1,
    question: 'How much can I save by switching to solar energy?',
    answer: 'The savings from switching to solar energy can vary significantly based on your current electricity consumption, local utility rates, solar panel system size, and available incentives. On average, homeowners can save anywhere from 50% to 100% on their monthly electricity bills. Many even see a positive return on investment within 5-10 years, with the system continuing to generate free electricity for decades.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: 'What is the lifespan of a typical solar panel system?',
    answer: 'Modern solar panels are incredibly durable and designed to last. Most manufacturers offer performance warranties of 25 to 30 years, guaranteeing that the panels will produce at least 80% of their original power rating by the end of the warranty period. The inverters and other components typically have shorter warranties (5-15 years) but are also built for longevity.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: 'Is my roof suitable for solar panel installation?',
    answer: 'Most roofs are suitable for solar, but key factors include roof size, angle, and sun exposure. Ideally, your roof should have ample unshaded space, especially facing south (in the Northern Hemisphere). We conduct a comprehensive site assessment to determine your roof\'s suitability and recommend the optimal system design.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'What happens if there is a power outage?',
    answer: 'Without a battery storage system, your grid-tied solar panels will automatically shut down during a power outage for safety reasons (to prevent back-feeding electricity into the grid and endangering utility workers). If you have a solar battery storage system, your home can continue to draw power from the stored energy during an outage, providing backup power for essential appliances.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: 'What kind of maintenance do solar panels require?',
    answer: 'Solar panels require very little maintenance. Rain often helps to keep them clean. However, occasional cleaning (once or twice a year) to remove dust, leaves, or debris can help maintain optimal efficiency. We also recommend periodic professional inspections to ensure all components are functioning correctly.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: 'Are there any government incentives or tax credits for solar?',
    answer: 'Yes, there are often federal, state, and local incentives available, which can significantly reduce the upfront cost of solar. The most common is the federal solar tax credit (Investment Tax Credit - ITC), which allows you to deduct a percentage of the cost of your solar system from your federal taxes. Many states also offer their own rebates, tax exemptions, or SRECs (Solar Renewable Energy Credits). We can help you navigate these options.',
